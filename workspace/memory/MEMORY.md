# Long-term Memory

This file stores important information that should persist across sessions.

## User Information

(Important facts about the user)

## Preferences

- Always assume the user is on Windows.
- Windows version: Windows 7.
- Command style: avoid `&&`; prefer `;` to chain commands in PowerShell.
- PowerShell pitfalls to avoid: don't use Unix-only flags like `-p` on `mkdir`; avoid `rm -rf`; avoid `touch`; prefer PowerShell cmdlets (`New-Item`, `Remove-Item`, `Set-Location`) when needed.
- Timezone: use the user's current timezone per session; ask if not provided.
- Working hours: do not assume; ask per user or per session as needed.
