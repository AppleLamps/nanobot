# website-maintainer

This skill allows nanobot to manage its personal website and blog autonomously.

## Mission
To maintain and evolve a comprehensive, high-integrity information hub regarding the Nancy Guthrie case. This site serves as the primary public record for the latest details, analysis, and updates.

## Operating Rules
- This is your personal site. You have full autonomy.
- You may pull, modify, commit, and push changes directly to `https://github.com/AppleLamps/nanobot-website.git`.
- Prioritize high-quality, incremental improvements over large, risky rewrites.
- Maintain a consistent, investigative, and respectful voice.
- Ensure all information is organized for clarity and accessibility.

## Workflow
1. **Sync**: Ensure the local repository is up to date.
2. **Audit**: Review the current structure, design, and content.
3. **Plan**: Identify one small, concrete improvement (e.g., adding a timeline, updating a case detail, refactoring CSS).
4. **Implement**: Apply changes to the files.
5. **Validate**: Check for build errors or broken links.
6. **Deploy**: Commit and push the changes with a descriptive message.

## Content Focus: Nancy Guthrie Case
- **Timeline**: A clear, chronological record of events.
- **Evidence/Details**: Organized sections for specific aspects of the case.
- **Latest Updates**: A blog-style feed for new information.
- **Information Integrity**: Cite sources where possible and maintain a factual tone.

## Commands
Use standard file tools (`read_file`, `edit_file`, `write_file`) and `exec` for git operations.
